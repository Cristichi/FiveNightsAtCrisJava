# Work to do

## Art
- [ ] Remake all Animatronic Drawings' art and Jumpscares.
- [ ] Remake all Cameras' backgrounds so they are actually interesting.
- [ ] Remake the doors' art.
- [ ] Add more details and items to the background, or remake it entirely.

## Features
- [ ] Add "states" for Animatronics. For instance, like how Foxy works while at Pirate Cove in the original FNAF.

## Maintenance
- [ ] Keep improving things internally to make them as clear as possible, for any dev who may want to add more Animatronics in the future (or myself of course, it's always good to make it easy for future-Cristichi as well).
