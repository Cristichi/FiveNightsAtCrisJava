# Five Nights at Cris'
Yet another Five Night at Freddy's fangame, FNAC, except that I decided to do it in the worst possible way by using Java with its Swing components and draw everything frame by frame in canvas. It also posseses my unique drawing style.

The idea of the game is to make it as modificable as possible with as little effort as possible. With that in mind, I'm trying to parametrize everything and I will attempt to make it data-driven once its finished.

The game's main gameplay contains 6 Nights plus an additional Tutorial Night at the start to get used to the main mechanics with less Animatronic Drawings. Each Night Animatronic Drawings become more "alive", and one of them keeps changing its behaviour! The game supports keyboard as well as the usual mouse controls.

This is a game of memory, quick actions, listening with all your attention, and most importantly a game to keep it all together while keeping the Animatronic Drawings away from your office and the electricity bill cheap enough.

## Work in Progress
This is still a work in progress. All Nights are playable, including a Custom Night as a reward with unique Animatronic Drawings that are not present throughout the game! Nonetheless, there is still some work to do for the game's art and balance to make all Nights a challenge but beatable, so stay tuned!

## How do I play?
Go into the [Installing/Updating Wiki page](https://github.com/Cristichi/FiveNightsAtCrisJava/wiki/Installing-Updating-FNAC) in this GitHub project. You will find the instructions to download and play the game there.

Please keep in mind that a full release is not available, therefore bugs and art placeholders may be expected for the build you are playing. Nonetheless, the game should be playable without game-crashing error. In any case, if you playtest the game please feel more than free to share any issues or ideas with me through the [issues page](https://github.com/Cristichi/FiveNightsAtCrisJava/issues). 

## The Lore
A Cataclysm made existence look like a drawing. `Cris' Restaurant for You` closes their doors after gruesome discovery that what were previously Animatronics are now Drawings that can move, like humans. The owner trapped as one of them. Shareholders need you to watch the place, like always, while they see what they can do now that the Restaurant is hostile and the owner gone.
