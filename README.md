### Five Nights at Cris'
Just another Five Night at Freddy's fangame, FNAC, except that I decided to do it in the worst possible way by using only vanilla Java with its Swing components and draing everything frame by frame. It also posseses my unique drawing style.

## Work in Progress
This is still a work in progress, in early stages of development. The Tutorial night is playable, but it is not finished as not all the mechanics are implemented and it offers no explanation of said mechanics at the moment. Also, the simple map present in the Tutorial night will not be used for the rest of the game.

Once the mechanics and the Tutorial night are completed, the rest should be much faster to develop. Nonetheless, everything requires a lot of work on the visual images, which is what it's going to need the most time.

## The idea
The idea of the game is to make it as modificable as possible with as little effort as possible. With that in mind, I'm trying to parametrize everything and I will attempt to make it data-driven once its finished.

The game will have a total of 6 nights, a backstory and support for keyboard controls, as well as the mouse controls that characterize the original franchise and fan-made games.

## How do I play?
Not yet! I will release a "demo" as soon as all the mechanics are fully developed. After the game is complete, and perhaps along the way after each new night is fully playable, I will keep releasing new versions here on GitHub for anyone to play. In the future, this work will remain fully free to use for anyone to download, play, or fork into their own versions of FNAC.
