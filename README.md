### Five Nights at Cris'
Just another Five Night at Freddy's fangame, FNAC, except that I decided to do it in the worst possible way by using only vanilla Java with its Swing components and doing everything frame by frame. It also posseses my unique drawing style.

## Work in Progress
This is still a work in progress. The Tutorial Night and some of the Nights are mostly finished and 100% playable. Nonetheless, there is still some work to do for the game mechanics and future Nights, so stay tuned!

## The idea
The idea of the game is to make it as modificable as possible with as little effort as possible. With that in mind, I'm trying to parametrize everything and I will attempt to make it data-driven once its finished.

The game will have a total of 6 nights, a backstory and support for keyboard controls, as well as the mouse controls that characterize the original franchise and fan-made games.

## How do I play?
Go into the [Wiki in this GitHub project](https://github.com/Cristichi/FiveNightsAtCrisJava/wiki), and look for Installing in the menu. You will find the instructions there. Please keep in mind that a full release is not available, only pre-release builds to show how things are going. Nothing stops you having fun with the first few Nights, tho!
